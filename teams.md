# This is a file containing all of our current teams, their specialisations as well as the supervisors handling them.
The categories are in order of specialisation, but the order of supervisors is random. The most category is always first, and the sub-categories follow. Moderators are welcome to review other categories, and to get enabled in them should contact a supervisor that supervises one of these categories (preferably as a main category).
