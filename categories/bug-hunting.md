### Moderating Bug Hunting Posts

This guide is to inform moderators about the reviewing process of [Bug Hunting](https://utopian.io/bug-hunting/review) category. 

**Reminder**: Please, see [Utopian Rules](https://utopian.io/rules) to learn about the up-to-date rules first. 

### Formatting and Content Problems
- The moderators should try to reproduce the bug before accepting the contribution.
- The author is suggested to provide a GIF to reproduce the bug. A video is OK but when pushing to github (issues), the video can only be displayed as a URL.
- The posts should not contain information (such as Links, promoting messages) other than bug descriptions.
- The code repository should be precise and correct.
- The screenshots should contain the minimal information and should not leak personal or other irrelevant information.

### Red Flags (Instant Hide)
- The moderators can hide the posts if similar bug hunting contributions have been approved already. 
- The posts should be hidden immediately if it is kinda of 'feature' or related to user's behaviors.
