### Moderating Development Posts

This guide is to inform moderators about the reviewing process of [Development](https://utopian.io/development/review) category. 

**Reminder**: Please, see [Utopian Rules](https://utopian.io/rules) to learn about the up-to-date rules first. 

### Formatting and Content Problems
- The post should not have LICENSE details, instead, the LICENSE can be optionally put in the code repository.
- The post should not have `follow me, resteem` kind of things.
- The author is suggested to format the lengthy github commit URL using a short one.
- The code repository must be precise and correct.
- We should actually accept only pull requests. The users should use pull requests instead of direct commits in the branch.
- The readme file or that the PR must not be older than 30 days.

### Red Flags (Instant Hide)
- The code should be good quality i.e. should be well formatted with consistent indent and contains descriptive comments.
- Some code repositories are copied from textbook examples, and we should hide them instantly. Always search some key code in the repository for plagrisim.
- Some code repros has `Form1.cs` which is the default file names generated by IDEs,  the developers didn't change the filename, so this is a indication that the code repro is copied from something like tutorials
- The code repository should at least have a descriptive README (project descriptions)
- If the author can not prove the code repository is his/her work, we should hide the posts instantly. For example, the author can provide screenshots of github once and later he/she doens't need to be verified each time.
- If the author has shared the code repository in other places, he/she must not copy exactly same texts without making a significant changes in both text and code repository.
