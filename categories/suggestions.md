# Moderating Suggestions Contributions

**Reminder:** Please read the current [Utopian Rules](https://utopian.io/rules) first, to bring yourself up to date.

The [Suggestions](https://utopian.io/ideas/review) category is very formal and follows strict rules. Suggestions are minor features/enhancements that you would like to have in an Open Source project, may be only related to the technical aspects of the project not process or organisational issues and must provide all the details for the requested features to be actually built.
Irrelevant information should be avoided. Mockups/screenshots are important

## Small/trivial Suggestions

Small/trivial Suggestions are common features in similar projects and should be rejected and replied with a well explained Comment. (Also inviting the user to Discord for a longer explanation is well appreciated)
Examples: **FAQs** in a site, **Random** in a Music player, **Reputation point** in the Steem ecosystem.

## Format

Suggestions should be divided by titles like **Intro/Problem/Suggestion** to make it as easy as possible to review them. 
Title should be explanatory to help Moderators and Users to find similar posts.
Irrelevant information, such as personal stories, unrelated links, images or video parts, should be avoided.

> **Relevant information**
> 
> *adding this section for a better organization*

> **Irrelevant information:**
> *Hello Steemians, I am happy to show you my new idea for the best app in steem.*

## Images
Screenshots are very important to show the idea. Is not necessary if the project has not UI. 
Screenshots should be of good quality and focused on the new feature and not in the whole screen.
*Optional:* GIFs are useful to show the problem which will be solved with the new idea.

### Checklist

- [ ] Check if the Repository is correct.
- [ ] Check if the idea was submitted before.
- [ ] Check the format.
- [ ] Check if the suggestion  is not against the main idea of the project. *(Example: Remove videos from dTube)*
- [ ] Check if the idea is not a small/trivial Suggestion
